# Python Program: Displaying and Calculating the Sum of List Elements

This repository showcases a beginner-friendly Python script that uses a for loop to print each item in a list and compute their total sum.

# Objective
The purpose of this program is to:

- Iterate through a list and display each number.

- Compute the total of all values in the list using a for loop.

# Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Working with lists

- Using for loops to iterate over elements

- Implementing the accumulator pattern

- Applying string formatting with the print() function

# Why This is Useful

This program is ideal for beginners to practice how to:

- Loop through list items effectively

- Accumulate values during iteration

- Understand and apply simple logic inside loops
